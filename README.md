# Mushaf-KFGQPC
This is the version of KFGQPC mushaf that has its ayat numbers corrected.

May Allah reward King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex for issuing the mushaf in a digital format available here https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp02/حفص
This mushaf comes with the KFGQPC HAFS Uthmanic Script font. This beautiful font is similar to the printed text font but it has one major flaw.  The numbers are rendered right-to-left, instead of left-to-right, therefore ayat numbers are backward. 

The correct way to fix this issue would be to edit the font to render the numbers from left-to-right but I couldn't figure that out so I wrote a script to reiterate each number backward. It is now visually correct but if you make a search, you would have to search for '21' to find '12.
